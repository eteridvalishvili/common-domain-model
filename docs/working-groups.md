## Working Groups

Changes to the CDM may be proposed by CDM Working Groups, individual corporate contributors, or individual contributors.

**Any Participant may propose a Working Group.** Proposals for the formation of a new Working Group are made by completion of a [new CDM Working Group](https://github.com/finos/common-domain-model) template, clearly stating the objectives, deliverables and committed maintainers/editors for the proposed Working Group. 

**Approval of Specification Changes by Working Groups.** Participants of each Working Group approve the “proposed” changes from that working group; the “approved changes” within a given Working Group will be brought to the Steering Working Group as a proposed “Pre-Draft” contribution.
