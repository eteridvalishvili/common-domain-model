title: The Common Domain Model
---

**There are seven modelling dimensions** to the CDM, which are detailed
in the following sections:

- [product model](product-model.md) 
- [event model](event-model.mf) 
- [legal agreements](legal-agreements.md)
- [process model](process-model.md)
- [reference data model](reference-data-model.md) 
- [mapping](mapping.md)
- [namespace](namespace.md)


In each section, selected examples of model definitions are used as
illustrations to help explain each dimension and include, where
applicable, data samples to help demonstrate the structure.

The CDM is expressed in a language called the Rune DSL. All the
language components used by the CDM including types, functions and
annotations are described in the [Rune DSL Documentation](https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/rosetta/rosetta-dsl/rune-modelling-component).
