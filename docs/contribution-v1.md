## CDM Design Principles

Contributions to the CDM have to comply with the following set of design principles that include the following concepts:

* **Normalisation** through abstraction of common components
* **Composability** where objects are composed and qualified from the bottom up
* **Mapping** to existing industry messaging formats
* **Embedded logic** to represent industry processes
* **Modularisation** into logical layers

 For more detailed explanations, please refer to our [Design Principles](design-principles.md) page. 

## CDM development guidelines 

The CDM Development Guidelines are defined by the Steering Working Group. The full set of CDM development guidelines can be found [here](https://cdm.docs.rosetta-technology.io/source/contribution.html).

## Version Management

The CDM is developed, built and released using standard software
source-control management. Each new released version is announced to
users via a *release note* that describes the change introduced by that
new version. The CDM release history is available in the [Release
Section](#) of the CDM documentation.

Information on semantic versioning, backwards compatibility and version availability can be found [here.](versioning.md)



## Agile Development Approach

The on-going development of the CDM adheres to a methodology inspired by
the *Agile* software development framework. This methodology is based on
two high-level principles:

1.  Focus on business value from the user's perspective, encapsulated
    in the concept of *user story*
2.  Delivery of small, releasable changes that contribute to that
    business value (sometimes referred to as *shippable increments*) -
    i.e. no "big bang" changes

Development by the CDM Maintainer team is being planned along a series
of 2-week *sprints* aligned onto the CDM Architecture and Review
Committee cycle. This development is guided by high-level priorities set
on a quarterly basis. 

Outside [contributions](#how-to-contribute) that are proposed by
industry members, whilst not formally enlisted in the sprint process,
usually generate additional tasks (design, review, deployment etc.) for
the CDM Maintainer team that will need to be included in a sprint. Those
outside contributions still need to comply with the above development
principles to ensure a smooth integration with the rest of the
development by the CDM Maintainer team.
